**System Architecture Document for OpenRoad**

---

### 1. **Introduction**

The OpenRoad project aims to develop a comprehensive Road Traffic System that caters to governments, organizations, and individuals. The system focuses on transparency, security, scalability, and interoperability. This document outlines the architecture of the system, emphasizing its components, interactions, and deployment.

---

### 2. **Objectives**

- Enable secure and transparent traffic monitoring.
- Provide scalable and interoperable solutions for different stakeholders.
- Leverage modern technologies for data management and real-time analytics.

---

### 3. **System Overview**

The OpenRoad system consists of three primary layers:

1. **Data Collection Layer**:

   - Traffic sensors (IoT devices).
   - Mobile apps for citizen reporting.
   - Cameras and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems.

2. **Data Processing Layer**:

   - Backend services for data ingestion and transformation.
   - Machine learning models for traffic prediction and anomaly detection.
   - Event-driven architecture for real-time processing.

3. **Presentation Layer**:
   - Web-based dashboards for administrators and policymakers.
   - Mobile applications for drivers and citizens.
   - APIs for third-party integrations.

### 5. **Component Description**

1. **Frontend**:

   - Web application built using React or Angular.
   - Mobile application developed in Flutter for cross-platform compatibility.
   - User-centric design focusing on usability.

2. **Backend**:

   - Services developed using Go, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails.
   - GraphQL APIs for flexible data querying.
   - PostgreSQL and MongoDB for structured and unstructured data.

3. **Data Layer**:

   - AWS S3 for data storage.
   - Apache Kafka for event streaming.
   - Elasticsearch for real-time querying.

4. **Security**:

   - OAuth2 and JWT for authentication.
   - Data encryption (AES-256) for sensitive information.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC).

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring.
   - ELK Stack for centralized logging.

---

### 6. **Deployment**

- **Containerization**:

  - Docker for application containerization.
  - Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling.

- **CI/CD**:

  - GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

- **Cloud Provider**:
  - AWS as the primary cloud provider for now.

---

### 7. **Scalability and Interoperability**

- Horizontal scaling of backend services through Kubernetes.
- Interoperability ensured via RESTful APIs and standardized data formats like JSON and XML.
